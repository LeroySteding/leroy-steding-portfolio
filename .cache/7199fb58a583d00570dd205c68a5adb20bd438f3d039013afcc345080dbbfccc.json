This file should be in the `.storybook` folder in your project's root directory. You can author this file in either JavaScript or [TypeScript](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/configure/integration/typescript). Listed below are the available options and examples of how to use them.\nCSF 3CSF Next 🧪\n.storybook/main.ts\nTypescript\n```\n// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using, e.g. react-vite, nextjs, vue3-vite, etc.\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  // Required\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],\n  // Optional\n  addons: ['@storybook/addon-docs'],\n  staticDirs: ['../public'],\n};\nexport default config;\n```\nℹ️\nThis configuration file is a [preset](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/addons/addon-types) and, as such, has a powerful interface, which can be further customized. Read our documentation on writing [presets](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/addons/writing-presets) to learn more.\n| Configuration element | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `stories` | The array of globs that indicates the [location of your story files](#configure-story-loading), relative to `main.js` |\n| `staticDirs` | Sets a list of directories of [static files](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/configure/integration/images-and-assets#serving-static-files-via-storybook-configuration) to be loaded by Storybook\n`staticDirs: ['../public']` |\n| `addons` | Sets the list of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/integrations) loaded by Storybook\n`addons: ['@storybook/addon-docs']` |\n| `typescript` | Configures how Storybook handles [TypeScript files](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/configure/integration/typescript)\n`typescript: { check: false, checkOptions: {} }` |\n| `framework` | Configures Storybook based on a set of [framework-specific](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/configure/integration/frameworks) settings\n`framework: { name: '@storybook/svelte-vite', options:{} }` |\n| `core` | Configures Storybook's [internal features](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/api/main-config/main-config-core)\n`core: { disableTelemetry: true, }` |\n| `docs` | Configures Storybook's [auto-generated documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/writing-docs/autodocs)\n`docs: { defaultName: 'Documentation' }` |\n| `features` | Enables Storybook's [additional features](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/api/main-config/main-config-features)\nSee table below for a list of available features |\n| `refs` | Configures [Storybook composition](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/sharing/storybook-composition)\n`refs: { example: { title: 'ExampleStorybook', url:'https://your-url.com' } }` |\n| `logLevel` | Configures Storybook's logs in the browser terminal. Useful for debugging\n`logLevel: 'debug'` |\n| `webpackFinal` | Customize Storybook's [Webpack](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/builders/webpack) setup\n`webpackFinal: async (config:any) => { return config; }` |\n| `viteFinal` | Customize Storybook's Vite setup when using the [vite builder](https://github.com/storybookjs/builder-vite)\n`viteFinal: async (config: Vite.InlineConfig, options: Options) => { return config; }` |\n| `env` | Defines custom Storybook [environment variables](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/configure/environment-variables#using-storybook-configuration).\n`env: (config) => ({...config, EXAMPLE_VAR: 'Example var' }),` |\n| `build` | Optimizes Storybook's production [build](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/api/main-config/main-config-build) for performance by excluding specific features from the bundle. Useful when decreased build times are a priority.\n`build: { test: {} }` |\n##\n[Configure story loading](#configure-story-loading)\nBy default, Storybook will load stories from your project based on a glob (pattern matching string) in `.storybook/main.js|ts` that matches all files in your project with extension `.stories.*`. The intention is for you to colocate a story file along with the component it documents.\n```\n•\n└── components\n    ├── Button.js\n    └── Button.stories.js\n```\nIf you want to use a different naming convention, you can alter the glob using the syntax supported by [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#globbing-features).\nFor example, if you wanted to pull both `.md` and `.js` files from the `my-project/src/components` directory, you could write:\nCSF 3CSF Next 🧪\n.storybook/main.ts\nTypescript\n```\n// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using, e.g. react-vite, nextjs, vue3-vite, etc.\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  stories: ['../my-project/src/components/*.@(js|md)'],\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n###\n[With a configuration object](#with-a-configuration-object)\nAdditionally, you can customize your Storybook configuration to load your stories based on a configuration object. For example, if you wanted to load your stories from a `packages/components` directory, you could adjust your `stories` configuration field into the following:\nCSF 3CSF Next 🧪\n.storybook/main.ts\nTypescript\n```\n// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using, e.g. react-vite, nextjs, vue3-vite, etc.\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  stories: [\n    {\n      // 👇 Sets the directory containing your stories\n      directory: '../packages/components',\n      // 👇 Storybook will load all files that match this glob\n      files: '*.stories.*',\n      // 👇 Used when generating automatic titles for your stories\n      titlePrefix: 'MyComponents',\n    },\n  ],\n};\nexport default config;\n```\nWhen Storybook starts, it will look for any file containing the `stories` extension inside the `packages/components` directory and generate the titles for your stories.\n###\n[With a directory](#with-a-directory)\nYou can also simplify your Storybook configuration and load the stories using a directory. For example, if you want to load all the stories inside a `packages/MyStories`, you can adjust the configuration as such:\nCSF 3CSF Next 🧪\n.storybook/main.ts\nTypescript\n```\n// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using, e.g. react-vite, nextjs, vue3-vite, etc.\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  // 👇 Storybook will load all existing stories within the MyStories folder\n  stories: ['../packages/MyStories'],\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n###\n[With a custom implementation](#with-a-custom-implementation)\nYou can also adjust your Storybook configuration and implement custom logic to load your stories. For example, suppose you were working on a project that includes a particular pattern that the conventional ways of loading stories could not solve. In that case, you could adjust your configuration as follows:\nCSF 3CSF Next 🧪\n.storybook/main.ts\nTypescript\n```\n// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using, e.g. react-vite, nextjs, vue3-vite, etc.\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from '@storybook/your-framework';\nimport type { StoriesEntry } from 'storybook/internal/types';\nasync function findStories(): Promise<StoriesEntry[]> {\n  // your custom logic returns a list of files\n}\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: '@storybook/your-framework',\n  stories: async (list: StoriesEntry[]) => [\n    ...list,\n    // 👇 Add your found stories to the existing list of story files\n    ...(await findStories()),\n  ],\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n####\n[Known limitations](#known-limitations)\nBecause of the way stories are currently indexed in Storybook, loading stories on demand has a couple of minor limitations at the moment:\n-   [CSF formats](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/api/csf) from version 1 to version 3 are supported.\n-   Custom `storySort` functions are allowed based on a restricted API.\n##\n[Configure story rendering](#configure-story-rendering)\nTo control the way stories are rendered and add global [decorators](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/writing-stories/decorators#global-decorators) and [parameters](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/writing-stories/parameters#global-parameters), create a `.storybook/preview.js` file. This is loaded in the Canvas UI, the “preview” iframe that renders your components in isolation. Use `preview.js` for global code (such as [CSS imports](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/get-started/setup#render-component-styles) or JavaScript mocks) that applies to all stories.\nThe `preview.js` file can be an ES module and export the following keys:\n-   `decorators` - an array of global [decorators](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/writing-stories/decorators#global-decorators)\n-   `parameters` - an object of global [parameters](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/writing-stories/parameters#global-parameters)\n-   `globalTypes` - definition of [globalTypes](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/essentials/toolbars-and-globals#global-types-and-the-toolbar-annotation)\nIf you’re looking to change how to order your stories, read about [sorting stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/writing-stories/naming-components-and-hierarchy#sorting-stories).\n##\n[Configure Storybook’s UI](#configure-storybooks-ui)\nTo control the behavior of Storybook’s UI (the **“manager”**), you can create a `.storybook/manager.js` file.\nThis file does not have a specific API but is the place to set [UI options](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/configure/user-interface/features-and-behavior) and to configure Storybook’s [theme](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/configure/user-interface/theming).\nWas this page useful?\n👍👎\n[✍️ Edit on Github](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/docs/configure/index.mdx)\nOn this page\nJoin the community\nSubscribe\n7,044 developers and counting\n[](http://github.com/storybookjs)[](https://bsky.app/profile/storybook.js.org)[](https://twitter.com/storybookjs)[](https://discord.gg/storybook)[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr7Quur3eIyA_oe8FNYexfg)\nWhy\n[Why Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/why-storybook)[Component driven UI](https://componentdriven.org/)\nDocs\n[Guides](https://storybook.js.org/docs)[Tutorials](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials)[Changelog](https://storybook.js.org/releases)[Telemetry](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure/telemetry)\nCommunity\n[Addons](https://storybook.js.org/integrations)[Get involved](https://storybook.js.org/community)[Blog](https://storybook.js.org/blog)\nShowcase\n[Explore](https://storybook.js.org/showcase)[About](https://storybook.js.org/showcase/about)\nOpen source software\nMaintained by\n[Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/storybook?utm_source=storybook_website&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=storybook)\nSpecial thanks to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).",
