Note for ARM Users: Use the \\-arm suffix for pulling images. Example: `docker pull calcom/cal.com:v5.6.19-arm`.\n###\n[​\n](#contributing)\nContributing\nThe Docker configuration for Cal.com is officially maintained in the main Cal.com repository. The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are located in the root of the [calcom/cal.com repository](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com). If you want to contribute to the Docker setup, please open an issue or pull request in the [main Cal.com repository](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com).\n###\n[​\n](#requirements)\nRequirements\nMake sure you have `docker` & `docker compose` installed on the server / system. Note: `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, per the Docker documentation.\n###\n[​\n](#getting-started)\nGetting Started\n1.  Clone the Cal.com repository\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git\n    ```\n2.  Change into the directory\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    cd cal.com\n    ```\n3.  Prepare your configuration: Rename .env.example to .env and then update .env\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    cp .env.example .env\n    ```\n    Most configurations can be left as-is, but for configuration options see Important Run-time variables below. Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.\n4.  (optional) Pre-Pull the images by running the following command\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    docker compose pull\n    ```\n5.  Start Cal.com via docker compose (Most basic users, and for First Run) To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    docker compose up -d\n    ```\n    To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE\\_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    docker compose up -d calcom studio\n    ```\n    To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE\\_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    docker compose up -d calcom\n    ```\n6.  Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), or your defined NEXT\\_PUBLIC\\_WEBAPP\\_URL. The first time you run Cal.com, a setup wizard will initialize. Define your first user, and you’re ready to go!\n###\n[​\n](#update-calcom-instance)\nUpdate Calcom Instance\n1.  Stop the Cal.com stack\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    docker compose down\n    ```\n2.  Pull the latest changes\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    docker compose pull\n    ```\n3.  Update environment variables as necessary.\n4.  Re-start the Cal.com stack\n    Copy\n    Ask AI\n    ```\n    docker compose up -d\n    ```\n###\n[​\n](#configuration)\nConfiguration\n####\n[​\n](#build-time-variables)\nBuild-time variables\nThese variables must be provided at the time of the docker build, and can be provided by updating the .env file. Changing these is not required for evaluation, but may be required for running in production. Currently, if you require changes to these variables, you must follow the instructions to build and publish your own image.\n-   NEXT\\_PUBLIC\\_WEBAPP\\_URL\n-   NEXT\\_PUBLIC\\_LICENSE\\_CONSENT\n-   NEXT\\_PUBLIC\\_TELEMETRY\\_KEY\n####\n[​\n](#important-run-time-variables)\nImportant Run-time variables\n-   NEXTAUTH\\_SECRET\n##\n[​\n](#advanced-users-building-and-configuring)\nAdvanced Users - Building and Configuring\nFor more detailed instructions on how to build and configure your own Docker image, refer to the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml in the root of the [Cal.com repository](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com).\n##\n[​\n](#troubleshooting)\nTroubleshooting\n-   SSL edge termination: If running behind a load balancer which handles SSL certificates, you will need to add the environmental variable `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to prevent requests from being rejected. Only do this if you know what you are doing and trust the services/load-balancers directing traffic to your service.\n-   Failed to commit changes: Invalid ‘prisma.user.create()’: Certain versions may have trouble creating a user if the field `metadata` is empty. Using an empty json object `{}` as the field value should resolve this issue. Also, the `id` field will autoincrement, so you may also try leaving the value of `id` as empty.\n###\n[​\n](#client-fetch-error)\nCLIENT\\_FETCH\\_ERROR\nIf you experience this error, it may be the way the default Auth callback in the server is using the WEBAPP\\_URL as a base url. The container does not necessarily have access to the same DNS as your local machine, and therefor needs to be configured to resolve to itself. You may be able to correct this by configuring `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth`, to help the backend loop back to itself.\nCopy\nAsk AI\n```\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: [next-auth][error][CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR]\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: https://next-auth.js.org/errors#client_fetch_error request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost {\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   error: {\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     message: 'request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     stack: 'FetchError: request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.<anonymous> (/calcom/node_modules/next/dist/compiled/node-fetch/index.js:1:65756)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.emit (node:events:513:28)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.emit (node:domain:489:12)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.socketErrorListener (node:_http_client:494:9)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.emit (node:events:513:28)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.emit (node:domain:489:12)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at emitErrorNT (node:internal/streams/destroy:157:8)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at emitErrorCloseNT (node:internal/streams/destroy:122:3)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:83:21)',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     name: 'FetchError'\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   },\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   url: 'http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   message: 'request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost'\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: }\n```\nWas this page helpful?\nYesNo\n[Suggest edits](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/edit/main/docs/self-hosting/docker.mdx)[Raise issue](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/issues/new?title=Issue on docs&body=Path: /self-hosting/docker)\n[SSO setup](https://cal.com/docs/self-hosting/sso-setup)[License key](https://cal.com/docs/self-hosting/license-key)\n⌘I\n[x](https://x.com/calcom)[github](https://github.com/calcom)[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cal-com)\n[Powered by Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com?utm_campaign=poweredBy&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=calcom)",
