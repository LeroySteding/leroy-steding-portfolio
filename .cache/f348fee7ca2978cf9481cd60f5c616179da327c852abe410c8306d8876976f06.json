This will display _only_ the Booking Type you choose to embed.\n-   Embed your entire Booking Page. This will show all public Booking Types on an embed unit.\n## **1) Embed a specific Booking Type**\nTo get the embed code for a specific Booking Type:\n1.  Go to **Booking Types** in the top navigation menu\n2.  Find the Booking Type you want to embed\n3.  Click the **Share this booking type** button\n4.  In the modal that opens, click the **Embed on website** tab\n5.  Copy the embed code that appears\nYou can only embed one Booking Type per page.\n![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5a7dea9c2c7d3a4a4198fe11/images/649c6b021f9ba00c2bcf965a/file-9CM1BBlWSt.png)\nClick on the \"Embed on your website\" to embed a Booking Type.\n*Click on the \"Embed on your website\" to embed a Booking Type.*\nThe Booking Type embed code will look like this:\n![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5a7dea9c2c7d3a4a4198fe11/images/649c6b241f9ba00c2bcf965b/file-lEdUiL56oK.png)\nCopy the code and place it in the HTML of the active theme of your website. If you are unsure of how to do this, please contact your web platform's support team or your developer.\n## **2) Embed your entire Booking Page**\nTo embed your full Booking Page (that includes all public Booking Types), you just need to edit the embed code to remove the trailing slash from a Booking Type.\nFor example, this is the code to embed a 15-minute Booking Type:\n<script src=\"https://asset-tidycal.b-cdn.net//js/embed.js\"></script>\n<div id=\"tidycal-embed\" data-path=\"dkelly/15-minute-meeting\"></div>\nTo embed the entire Booking page, you can remove the \"/15-minute-meeting\" like below:\n<script src=\"https://asset-tidycal.b-cdn.net//js/embed.js\"></script>\n<div id=\"tidycal-embed\" data-path=\"dkelly\"></div>\nWhen you embed your entire Booking Page, it will look like this:\n![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5a7dea9c2c7d3a4a4198fe11/images/649c6be574f970393a8b07f0/file-tFUL9DShVP.png)\nAn example of an entire Booking Page embedded.\n*An example of an entire Booking Page embedded.*\nDid this answer your question?
