You can update the logo by changing the value of the following constants in `/packages/lib/constants.ts` file:\n1.  LOGO\n2.  LOGO\\_ICON to the file name of your logo and logo icon, or the paths with file name to your respective logo and logo icon images from `/web/public`.\n3\nInstance wide theming\nThe instance wide theme can be easily updated thanks to the color tokens we have in place. Simply modify the hex-codes within the `apps/web/styles/globals.css` file against the [color tokens](https://cal.com/docs/self-hosting/guides/white-labeling/color-tokens), and the entire application can be consistently whitelabeled to your brand identity.\nIf you’re using custom SMTP server for emails, you might need to set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` env variable equal to the path of your CA certificate so that it can be recognized by the calcom application.\nWas this page helpful?\nYesNo\n[Suggest edits](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/edit/main/docs/self-hosting/guides/white-labeling/introduction.mdx)[Raise issue](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/issues/new?title=Issue on docs&body=Path: /self-hosting/guides/white-labeling/introduction)\n[How to sync third party apps](https://cal.com/docs/self-hosting/guides/appstore-and-integration/syncing-third-party-apps)[How to add custom CSS](https://cal.com/docs/self-hosting/guides/white-labeling/custom-css)\n⌘I\n[x](https://x.com/calcom)[github](https://github.com/calcom)[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cal-com)\n[Powered by Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com?utm_campaign=poweredBy&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=calcom)",
